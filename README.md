Hi All!
I am a human who likes to read and figure out puzzles!
I learn best while trying things out for myself 
My hyperactive dog gets me off my computer so I don't become a complete screen junkie.
This tutorial on github is interesting and going to be useful in the future...

Here are 5 things as a customer champion I will definately enjoy doing:
1. Work with people to figure out if Zapier can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have
2. Act as a dedicated rep for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Zapier
3. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers
4. Help train and onboard new support teammates
5. Ghostwrite documentation for partners to publish on their own sites

Some of the things I won't enjoy so much:
1. Dig through activity logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken Zap
2. Help resolve billing issues for customers over the phone
3. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use
4. Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent across Zapier responses
5. Receive 20+ inbound phone calls per day and help them solve their issues
